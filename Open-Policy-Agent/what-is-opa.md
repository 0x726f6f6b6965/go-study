# What is open policy agent

## About Open Policy Agent

- The Open Policy Agent is an open soure policy engine that enables organizations to define and enforce policies across their software stack. It provides a unified approach to policy enforcement for various aspects of an application, such as access control, authorization, and data validation. 

- It is designed to be decoupled from the services it protects, making it versatile and suitable for use in microservices architectures, Kubernetes, and other cloud-native environments.

## Features

1. Declarative Policy Language
   - OPA uses a high-level, declarative policy language called Rego. This language allows users to express complex policies in a concise and readable manner.
2. Policy Decision Points (PDP)
   - OPA serves as a policy decision point, allowing you to query it with policy decisions. For example, you might ask OPA whether a particular user has permission to perform a specific action.
3. Integration Points
   - OPA can be integrated with various parts of your software stack, such as API gateways, microservices, Kubernetes, and more. This flexibility allows you to enforce policies consistently across different layers of your application.
4. Scalability
   - OPA is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for large and dynamic environments. It can handle a growing number of policies and policy evaluations efficiently.
